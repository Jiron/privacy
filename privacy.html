      <h3>3.1 What data we collect from you and from whom we receive this data</h3>

      <ul>
         <li>Personal master data (name, address, dates of birth, etc.);</li>
         <li>Contact information (cell phone number, email address, etc.);</li>
         <li>Financial data (e.g. account details);</li>

         <li>particularly sensitive data (e.g. biometric data or information about your health).</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>3.2 Under what conditions do we process your data?</h3>
      <p>We process your data in good faith and for the purposes set out in this privacy policy. In doing so, we ensure transparent and proportionate processing.<br><br>If, in exceptional cases, we are unable to comply with these principles, the data processing may still be lawful because there is a justification. A justification reason may be in particular:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Your consent;</li>
         <li>the execution of a contract or pre-contractual measures;</li>
         <li>our legitimate interests, unless your interests are overridden.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>3.3 How can you withdraw your consent?</h3>
      <p>If you have given us consent to process your personal data for specific purposes, we will process your data within the scope of this consent unless we have another justification.<br><br>You can revoke your consent at any time by sending an e-mail to the address given in the imprint. Data processing that has already taken place is not affected by this.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>3.4 In which cases can we share your data with third parties?</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>a. Principle</h4>
      <p>We may need to rely on the services of third parties or affiliates and engage them to process your data (known as processors). Categories of recipients are namely:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Accounting, fiduciary and auditing firm;</li>
         <li>Consulting firms (legal, tax, etc.);</li>

         <li>Provider of tracking, conversion and advertising services.</li>

      <br>
      <h4>b. Visiting our social media channels</h4>
      <p>We may have embedded links to our social media channels on our website. This is apparent to you in each case (typically via corresponding icons). If you click on the icons, you will be redirected to our social media channels.<br><br>In this case, the social media providers learn that you are accessing their platform from our website. The social media providers can use the data collected in this way for their own purposes. We would like to point out that we have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use by the operators.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>c. Transfer abroad</h4>
      <p>Under certain circumstances, your personal data may be transferred to companies abroad in the course of order processing. These companies are obligated to data protection to the same extent as we are. The transfer may take place worldwide.<br><br>If the level of data protection does not correspond to that in Switzerland, we carry out a prior risk assessment and ensure contractually that the same level of protection is guaranteed as in Switzerland (for example, by means of the new standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission or other legally prescribed measures). If our risk assessment is negative, we take additional technical measures to protect your data. You can access the EU Commission's standard contractual clauses at the following link. https://commission.europa.eu/publications/standard-contractual-clauses-controllers-and-processors-eueea_de</p>
      <br>
      <h3>3.5 How long do we keep your data?</h3>
      <p>We store personal data only for as long as is necessary to fulfill the individual purposes for which the data was collected.<br><br>Data that we store when you visit our website is kept for twelve months. An exception is made for analysis and tracking data, which may be kept longer.<br><br>We store contract data for longer, as we are obliged to do so by legal regulations. In particular, we must retain business communications, concluded contracts and accounting records for up to 10 years. As far as we no longer need such data from you to perform the services, the data will be blocked and we will only use it for accounting and tax purposes.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>3.6 How do we protect your data?</h3>
      <p>We will keep your information secure and take all reasonable steps to protect your information from loss, access, misuse or alteration.<br><br>Our contractual partners and employees who have access to your data are obliged to comply with data protection regulations. In some cases, it will be necessary for us to pass on your requests to companies affiliated with us. In these cases, too, your data will be treated confidentially.<br><br>Within our website, we use the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) procedure in conjunction with the highest encryption level supported by your browser.</p>

      <br>
      <h4>b. Deletion and correction</h4>
      <br>

We may reject the request if statutory provisions oblige us to store the data for a longer period or to retain it unchanged or if your request conflicts with a legal requirement.<br><br>Please note that exercising your rights may be in conflict with contractual agreements and may have corresponding effects on the performance of the contract (e.g. premature termination of the contract or cost consequences).</p>
      <br>
      <h4>c. Legal process</h4>
      <p>If you are affected by the processing of personal data, you have the right to enforce your rights in court or to file a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.
